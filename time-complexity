Time Complexity:
    Measures of how the running time of the algorithm increases with the size of the input data.

Big O Notation
    O(1) -> constant time
    O(log n) -> Logarithmic time
    O(n) ->     Linear Time
    O(n log n) ->   linearithmic time
    O(n^2) -> Quadratic time
    O(2^n) -> exponential time
    O(n!) -> Factorial time
